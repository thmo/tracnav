TracNav Plugin for Trac
----------------------------------------------------------------------


Description
-----------

The [[TracNav]] macro implements a fully customizable navigation bar
for the Trac wiki engine. The contents of the navigation bar is a wiki
page itself and can be edited like any other wiki page through the web
interface. The navigation bar supports hierarchical ordering of
topics. The design of TracNav mimics the design of the TracGuideToc
that was originally supplied with Trac. The drawback of TracGuideToc
is that it is not customizable without editing its source code and
that it does not support hierarchical ordering.


Usage
-----

To use TracNav, create an index page for your site and call the
TracNav macro on each page, where the navigation bar should be
displayed. The index page is a regular wiki page. The page with the
table of contents must include an unordered list of links that should
be displayed in the navigation bar.

To display the navigation bar on a page, you must call the TracNav
macro on that page and pass the name of your table of contents as
argument.

It is possible to have more than one index page for your toc: Simply
list them all separated by a bar like this:

[[TracNav(MyTOC|AnotherTOC)]]

The TOCs are appended to each other to form one navigation bar.


Installation
------------

See http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPlugins.

Short version for the impatient: run "python ./setup.py bdist_egg" and
copy the resulting .egg file from the "dist" directory to the
"plugins" directory of your Trac project. Using the WebAdmin plugin,
you can even upload and deploy the .egg file to your project using a
browser.

It is very likely that you have to override the location of the
temporary directory to which .egg files are unpacked by setting the
PYTHON_EGG_CACHE environment variable in your webserver's
configuration, see
http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPlugins#SettingupthePluginCache.
